# DMX Examples

A collection of examples for controlling DMX-512  devices, in a variety of programming environments.

Included in this repository are:

* [A Brief Introduction to DMX and sACN](dmx-intro.md)
* [Node.js examples with node-dmx](nodedmx.md)
* [Arduino examples using ArduinoDMX library](arduinodmx.md)
* Arduino examples using DMXSimple library
* [Addressable LED control through sACN with LeDMX Pro4](ledmx-pro4-control.md). Includes TouchDesigner and QLC+ configurations
* [sACN control through an DMXKing eDMX1 Pro](edmx-pro1-control.md). Includes TouchDesigner and QLC+ configuration.
* QLC+ examples

The Arduino circuits described in this repository use on these [breadboard layouts](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/breadboard-layouts/) for reference, and these [microcontroller pin arrangments](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/microcontroller-pin-functions/).
